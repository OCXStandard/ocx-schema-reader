Introduction
============

The ``ocx-schema-reader`` is a command line interface (cli) to inspect a version of the Open Class 3D Exchange (OCX) XSD schema.

Motivation
**********

The application enables a more human-friendly way to review an XSD schema without the need for using an XML tool as XMLSpy or Oxygen XML.


Limitations
***********

Only local XML files can be parsed.
